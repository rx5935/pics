# Custom Fractals
## The Repeated Motif - Self Similarity of lines
From the introduction, it can be said that the main characteristic of a fractal is its self-similarity - a fractal figure repeats certain geometry in various scale.

Since a line features length but no area, it can be said that a line is always self similar to oneself regardless of its length. A line segment can be scaled up or down to the length of another line segment. Using this, we can generate a large group of fractals.

## A Base and A motif
Many fractals can be generated by replacing a line with a motif that can be viewed as a pattern composed with lines. Taking Figure 1 as a visual guide, take a line and replace that line with a pattern that is made out of lines - this will be our motif(Figure 2). Then, replace the line segments that composes the motif with the motif. Then again, replace the motif's line segments with the motifs again. Repeating this step will result in Figure 3.

Now, a base can be something more than just a line. It can be any polygon, since they are compose with lines. Viewing the fractal pattern we made above as a line segment, we can build a square of a triangle out of it. Figure 5 and Figure 6 shows the steps of our fractal pattern when our base is either an inverted triangle or a square.

## Koch island analyzed using the Base and Motif method

The famous Koch island pattern can be analyzed as a fractal made with a triangular base and Figure 7 as its motif.
